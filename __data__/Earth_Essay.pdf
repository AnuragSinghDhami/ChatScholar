Earth - Our Home Planet
Earth is the third planet from the Sun and the only known planet to support life. 
It is often called the "Blue Planet" because of its vast oceans, which cover about 71% of its surface. 
The remaining landmasses consist of continents, mountains, deserts, and forests that provide a
home for millions of species, including humans.
Earth has a protective atmosphere that shields us from harmful radiation and helps maintain a stable
climate. 
Natural resources like water, soil, and air make life possible. However, human activities such as
pollution and deforestation are harming our planet.
We must protect Earth by conserving resources, planting trees, and reducing waste. 
A healthy Earth ensures a healthy future for all living beings.
